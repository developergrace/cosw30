<p class="blurb">Hi, I'm Grace! In my childhood, I developed a passion for designing beautiful web pages and thus spurred
my decision to attend LBCC. I'm a curious individual, hardworking team player, and am excited about diving into the world
 of front-end web development.</p>

        <p class="about">I come preloaded with HTML and CSS knowledge. I've been creating fun webpages with them since about
         6th grade so they are almost second-nature to me. Through my educational journey, I've added the following
         languages and tools to my arsenal:
         <ul>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>mySQL</li>
            <li>AWS</li>
            <li>Bulma</li>
            <li>Boostrap</li>
            <li>Skeleton</li>
            <li>SASS/SCSS</li>
            <li>Github</li>
         </ul> 
        I've completed and received the MTA: Introduction to Programming Using HTML and CSS - Certified 2019.

        <p class="about">I enjoy the design process and am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge. 
        I will be continuing my education at LBCC and have about one semester left before receiving my Certificate of 
        Achievement in Web Development. Unfortunately, one of my classes is not available in Spring 2020, but I will be 
        spending this time polishing up my portfolio and applying for junior developer positions.</p>
        <p>Spring 2020 will be focused on delving into JavaScript and WordPress. In addition, I will be expanding upon
        my familiarity with SASS and responsive design.
